This is the README for my labs project. Lets try once more. Ok so Pull worked. 
Lets try the other way. Push seems to work
Lets try fetch. Fetch was not working. Now it works if you do git fetch and git merge origin/master. 
Trying the other way then. This worked so - the idea is to use git fetch [alias] and then do git merge [alias]/[branch name]
